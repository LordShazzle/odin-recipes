    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> To begin with, first, clean and wash the chicken well, drain the water completely.</li>

        <li> Cover and allow it to rest for 30 minutes under refrigeration.</li>
        <li> While the meat is marinating, clean wash and soak rice for 30 minutes (15 minutes for Instant Pot pressure Cooker Version).</li>
        <li> In a large pot, add enough water and salt. Bring the water to a boil and add rice. Then, cook the rice until 70 percent done.</li>
